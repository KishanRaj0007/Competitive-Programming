1. For questions related to parity(odd, even), try to come up with solution by analyzing odd as 1 and even as 0. For example in an array having even frequency of odd numbers, it is always
  possible to divide array in two parts such that sum of both parts will have same parity.

2. To find the length of largest interval  [l,r](which isr-l+1) of positive integers(consecutive) such that, for every i in the interval (i.e., l≤i≤r), n is a multiple of i or i is a factor of n,
   we will simplify the problem by focussing on intervals starting from 1. If you find smallest integer x that does not divide n then the length of interval [1, x-1] which is ((x-1) - 1 +1) = x-1
   is the required length.
